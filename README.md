# Payroll Cost & Headcount Analysis for CoreQuota (Case Study)
This self-designed case study simulates a strategic FP&A request from CoreQuota, a fictional high-growth company investing heavily in Engineering and Sales. The project features a cleaned Excel dataset and a dynamic Tableau dashboard designed to support executive decision-making on departmental budgeting and workforce planning.

## 🛠️ Project Background
This project started when I came across a headcount planning Excel template online and decided to use it for practice. As I worked through the data, I began imagining the kinds of questions a company’s leadership team might ask about hiring, compensation, and budgeting.

That curiosity turned a simple exercise into a complete case study. I created CoreQuota, a fictional high-growth company, and built a Tableau dashboard designed to answer the kinds of strategic questions a real FP&A team would face during board meetings.

## 🎯 Objective Answer key FP&A questions with clarity and strategic insight: 
- 💸 How much is CoreQuota spending by department?
- 📈 What is the forecasted salary for each department next year?
- 🏛️ What is the total payroll cost per department over multiple years?
- 🏆 Which departments receive the highest budget allocations?
- 👥 What does month-over-month headcount growth look like?

## 🔍 Key Insights
- **Departmental Spending Breakdown** CoreQuota’s payroll expenditures are concentrated across four departments: Engineering, Sales & Marketing, General & Administration, and Operations. Engineering leads with the highest spend, followed closely by Sales & Marketing.
- **Stable Salary Forecasts** Salaries for the upcoming year are expected to remain consistent across all departments, allowing leadership to focus on headcount planning and budget distribution without adjusting for wage inflation.
- **Historical Payroll Cost Trends** Payroll costs show steady increases year-over-year, primarily driven by expanded headcount in high-impact teams. Engineering and Sales & Marketing consistently occupy the largest share of overall spending.
- **Budget Allocation Focus** Engineering and Sales & Marketing together account for the majority of CoreQuota’s payroll budget, reflecting their central roles in product delivery and revenue generation.
- **MoM Headcount Dynamics** Month-over-month headcount tracking reveals cyclical hiring patterns, with visible growth phases and stable retention in most departments.
